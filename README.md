## cordova-plugin-httpserver-dynamic

A plugin for Apache Cordova that runs a web server that is able to serve dynamic content.
Android support available now, iOS to come soon.

## Documentation

Full documentation is available in the README file of the `plugin` directory, and should be
viewable [here](https://github.com/jh3141/cordova-plugin-httpserver-dynamic/tree/master/plugin/).

## Example

A brief example is included in the repository in the `example` folder.  This shows how to
create a server and respond to requests with dynamic content (in this case a text string
that includes a number that increments for each request processed).  The example also logs
all data provided with each incoming request, so you can experiment with different request
types and see how they are presented.
